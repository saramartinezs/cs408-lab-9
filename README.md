# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

The purpose of this lab was to get some practice with JavaScript. We were provided with the code
for a bouncy ball demo. The additions to the code included an "evil circle" that can consume the 
bouncy balls. The number of bouncy balls consumed is kept track of in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
